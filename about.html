        <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>Hello, and Welcome!</h2>
<p>My name is Marissa Dibba, I'm a Marketing and Communications professional, with over 15 years of industry experience. I am currently employed at Hennepin Technical College. Previously I worked for Nystrom in various Marketing Communications and Digital roles, and before that an Associate Web Producer and Social Media Manager at Blanks/USA, in Minneapolis, MN.</p>

<p>Through the years I've explored business, architecture, drafting, design, data and technology. I've worked in printing and pre-press, when printing was cool. It was then, my <strong><em>A-ha!</em></strong> moment that I realized marketing and communications was my jam.</p>
<p>When I'm not planning my next project or "Marissifying" pieces, you'll find me enjoying the outdoors, hanging with family, or just being creative.</p>
<p>Think we could create smoething together? Feel free to <a href="#">contact me</a>.</p></main>
